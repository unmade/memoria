# As I was

_tl;dr: this is my braindump in format of a gitbook_

Recently, I felt like I started to rediscover information I've already known
or at least read about a while ago. It was until now I can hold all important
memories and things in my head, but with amount of information we absorb daily
it can be overwhelming for brain to filter that information properly.

I've always loved to keep things organized, sorted and logged. For example, 
the only reason I stay logged in in Google services is to get proper history
of what and when I visited.

But I've never thought of making a personal space in format of braindump,
until [karlicoss](https://github.com/karlicoss/exobrain) liked one of my repo
and it lead me to [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) wiki page.

So here it is, on the 14th of March 2020, my brain vault begins its journey.
