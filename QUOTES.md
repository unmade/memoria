Some quotes I've picked over the years on different topics.

---

> The absurd mystery of the strange forces of existence

This is not only a part of the title of David Lynch's unreleased Ronnie
Rocket movie, but also Albert Rosenfield words in Twin Peaks S03E03. David
also [mentioned] it on Letterman.

## Hackers

> hacker is just a person who hacks away the computer keyboard until the computer works

> a hacker never finishes the program. A hacker will get to a point where a program does something and maybe take a deep breath and say how can I make it do this, how can I make it do that and he'll just keep working.
