# macOS

I've been a mac user for over 10 years and now heavily relies on Apple
ecosystem. 

I try to keep my setup as minimal as possible. I stick with built-in apps
whenever it possible. First of all, they are good enough for me, and second - 
because they are part of Apple ecosystem they support all cool features, like
[Continuity]. I also install apps with AppStore whenever possible.

## Apps

### Safari

My main browser for everyday surfing. I don't use any extensions for it.

#### Some tips:

- [Link preview] - killer feature
- Use `âŒ˜ + /` to toggle full link displayed in the bottom left corner
- Any page can be saved to Apple Books as a PDF via Share menu.

### Terminal

I use standard macOS terminal with [my own theme] for it.

Since macOS Catalina I've switched to [Zsh] as my main shell.

### Notable Mentions

- [DjView] - relatively good open source `djvu` viewer, it can also export
  documents to PDF
- [Intel Power Gadget] - a tool to monitor your CPU
- [Raw Photo Processor (RPP)] - a RAW converter to work with colors

## Notes

### Remote access

You can access another mac from your mac. The other mac should [enable file
sharing].

[enable file sharing]: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-file-sharing-on-mac-mh17131/mac

Use these commands:

- `smb://192.168.255.255` - to mount shared mac in Finder
- `vnc://192.168.255.255` - for Screen Sharing
