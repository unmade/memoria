# Development

Here I'm gonna put things related to development. The goal is to 
collect some articles/talks/recipes that can stand the test of time.

In other knowledge base I saw, it is quite common to post just a bunch
of links. But often, some of these links are dead and they are hard to 
maintain. I think it would be better to have mixed approach - 
for each important article or topic there should be a summary or 
abstract, or even better, some code examples.
