# Python

I love python. If I were ever to write a programming language it'd looked like
python.

Most of my projects on a GitHub are written in Python. Some of them takes full
advantage of modern Python (type annotations, dataclasses, etc). Most of them
are example of how I structure code and how I pay attention to details, but
sometimes I can do odd things for the sake of trying something new.

Although Python is evolving rapidly, it's core remains the same. I'm going to
put here some articles and talks that are still relevant even some of them are
more than 5 years old.
